    1) Please fork this repo:
    https://github.com/payne/gs-validating-form-input  
    Background reading is at https://spring.io/guides/gs/validating-form-input/ 
    2) run it.   I like: `gradle bootRun`
    3) Add some fields and validations
    4) Write a method: savePerson(String fileName, PersonForm person) to append a CSV line to a file -- the data in the line should be from one instance of PersonForm
    5) call savePerson just before checkPersonInfo return results

    Send me a pull request with your changes.   Thanks! --Matt Payne
